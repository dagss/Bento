Common tasks for hooks:
	- create a new command.
	- pre/post customization
	- command overriding

Creating new command
--------------------

TODO:

	* configure parameters
	* command dependency
	* ?

Also think about installing "plugins" which consist in new commands, but of
course without pkg_resources. Look at bzr/hg way of doing things

Pre/post hooks
--------------

Requires to think a bit about command protocol:

	* what is done before a command is run ?
	* what can be done before/after
	* which options are given to which command ?
