Experiment to build extensions with waf 1.6. The example assumes that you have
a copy of the waflib directory, i.e.:

	bento.info
	bscript
	waflib

Alternatively, if you have WAFDIR environment variable defined, it will be used, e.g.::

	WAFDIR=$HOME/src/waf bentomaker ....

where WAFDIR is such as $WAFDIR/waflib contains waf code.
